        and availability may change at any time.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Bookings and Deposits</h2>
      <p>
        Tattoo appointments may require a deposit to confirm a date. Deposits are generally non-refundable, but may be

      <h2>3. Client Eligibility and Health Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        Clients must meet legal age requirements in their jurisdiction and provide accurate health information before

      </p>

      <h2>4. Session Rules</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to arrive on time, follow studio preparation instructions, and cooperate with hygiene and safety

      <h2>6. Aftercare and Liability</h2>
      <p>
        Healing results depend on aftercare and individual skin response. You are responsible for following aftercare
        instructions. The studio is not liable for outcomes caused by failure to follow care guidance or by undisclosed
        medical conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Print Orders, Shipping, and Returns</h2>
      <p>
        Print orders are processed after payment confirmation. Delivery times vary by destination. Report shipping

        required by law.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Payments and Pricing</h2>

      <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
